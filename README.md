source code for gunnorun

i decided to make it public because i plan to rewrite the game from scratch sometime in the future. idk if ill make that open source eventually too, but for the time being im focusing instead on making [wizhue](https://ana-rchy.itch.io/wizhue) into a full game

use the pre-refactor branch so it compiles properly

dont spam issues/PR kthxbye
